## Overview

In this project the goal was to make a recipe page based on an image provided by Frontend Mentor. I worked toward getting my site to match as closely as possible with the knowledge I've gained going through the W3Schools HTML and CSS course

## My process

I began by looking over all the documents from Frontend Mentor on what this project should look like. After I felt I had a good grasp on the goals, I began writing my CSS to make the colors and fonts match. After feeling comfortable with my CSS, I moved on to adding all the correct tags to the HTML and applying the styles. I spent a bit of time playing around with the sizes and placements to make my page match up with the images I was provided. After I felt like things were looking good, I added the image to the top of my page.
